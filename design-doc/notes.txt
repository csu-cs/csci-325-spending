spendingClassDiagram.dia:
This is a good start.  I do not see any GUI elements (JPanels, JButtons, etc...)  Please add
It is not necessary to list every category in a seperate class.

Grade:
Add the GUI elements and it should be good to go!  Then start coding!

Dr. West, so just make a master Category class and create subcategory objects? An as for user profile, should I try to work on a Linked list to enter each user name?
