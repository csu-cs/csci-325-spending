Please decide how to communicate (team member can edit this file.)

Some Suggestions:

Twitter: Setup a twitter account that any team member can post to.  This allows everyone to communicate at their leisure and provide a full history of what has been said.

IM/Hangouts/IRC: Share everyone's hangout/IM/IRC account so people can communicate in real time.

email: share everyone's email account to send message back and forth.

You may setup of physical meetings, but keep in mind that the online use will need to have a virtual presence!
